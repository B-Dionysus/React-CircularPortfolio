## Description
This is a employee directory app that lets users get information on fictional employees. It was created to demonstrate my comfort and fluency with REACT. All data is loaded via randomuser.me's API, at which point the user can soert the employees by first name, by laste name, or by age. The user can also search for an employee with the search bar, which will dynamically update the employee list as the user types. Clicking on a user will display their profile pic, as well as any public data about them. The page is separated into multiple components, and any or all of these can refresh without requiring the others to do so.

This app is fully responsive, and was designed with a "mobile-first" approach. It has sufficient aesthetic.

## Exciting Trivia
I am not entirely sure, but I think that at least some of this nostalgic aesthetic is due to the fact that I recently played a lot of Super Hot, which uses a similar early-90s look for its menus and meta-game. I never had an amber monitor myself--all of mine were P1 phosphor green--but I remember using the computer in my father's office to play games, and it had that lovely golden hue. Don't get me wrong, I'm still quite nostalgic for the green monochrom, but that look is a bit over-used.
